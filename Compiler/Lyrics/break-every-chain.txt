to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. 2x

[Chorus:]
There is power in the name of Jesus. [3x]
to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

[Verse]
There's an army rising up. [3x]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

[Chorus:]
There's an army rising up. [3x]
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain. [2x]

[Verse]
I hear the chains falling.

[Verse]
There is power in the name of Jesus.
to break every chain, break every chain, break every chain.
