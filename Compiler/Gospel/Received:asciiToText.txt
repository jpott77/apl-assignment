"Every Praise"
[Verse]
Every praise is to our God,
Every word of worship with one accord!
Sing hallelujah to our God.
Glory hallelujah is due our God.
Every praise every praise is to our God.
[Chorus]
God my Savior.
God my Healer.
God my Deliverer.
Yes He is, yes He is.
Yes He is, yes He is.
Yes He is, yes He is.
Every praise is to our God.
Every word of worship with one accord.
Every praise every praise.
Every praise every praise.
Is to our God.
